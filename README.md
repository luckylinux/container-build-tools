# Introduction
Common Tools to build Docker/Podman Containers.

# Motivation
I created a separate Repository for all the Docker/Podman Containers Building Tools.

This is to avoid having to Copy-Paste, Back-Forward Port all the Modifications etc.

# Get Started
Clone this Repository in a suitable Location.

```
git clone https://github.com/luckylinux/container-build-tools.git
```

# Including
I include this Library with my other Containers Building as a Symbolic Link named `includes` in the `root` Folder of the other Repository.

```
cd /path/to/my/container
ln -s /path/to/container-build-tools includes
```
